# routes

 I programmed a simple app to show you how to navigate to a new screen by creating a new route and pushing it to the Navigator. 

 To work with named routes, I used the Navigator.pushNamed() function.

## Getting Started

First, create two screens to work with. The first screen contains a button that navigates to the second screen. The second screen contains a button that navigates back to the first.
